This is a base project for the [Loopin](https://github.com/koopero/loopin) creative coding system. It includes all the boilerplate and dependencies required to start development of a Loopin application.

# Documentation

See [The Loopin Cookbook](COOKBOOK.md) for reference and setup instructions.

# Security Warning
The Loopin system intentionally creates a very promiscuous, completely unsecured local web server while this application is running. This server should not be exposed to open web, nor run in an environment where hooliganism is a possibility. For production applications, security *MUST* be implemented at the network layer.
