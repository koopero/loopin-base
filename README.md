This is a base project for the [Loopin](https://github.com/koopero/loopin) creative coding system. It includes all the boilerplate and dependencies required to start development of a Loopin application.

## Requirements

This project should work on a properly configured Mac, Linux or Windows box or a Raspberry Pi. For more detailed requirements, see [loopin-native](https://github.com/koopero/loopin-native). As well, to use the `recorder` function of this demo, you will need [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).

## Documentation

See [The Loopin Cookbook](COOKBOOK.md) for reference.

# Credits

The [Loopin](https://github.com/koopero/loopin) system would not be possible without the support of [HFour Design Studio](http://hfour.ca/).

# Security Warning
The Loopin system intentionally creates a very promiscuous, completely unsecured local web server while this application is running. This server should not be exposed to open web, nor run in an environment where hooliganism is a possibility. For production applications, security *MUST* be implemented at the network layer.
